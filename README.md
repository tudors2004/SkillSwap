# SkillSwap

**SkillSwap** is a Flutter mobile application that simplifies the exchange of knowledge and skills between users, where time is the sole currency.

### Project Overview

SkillSwap creates a fair, community-oriented economy where instead of paying for services with money, users exchange their abilities - for example, one hour of flute lessons for one hour of german tutoring, or two hours of padel coaching for two hours of IT support.

Each user has two profiles:
- **Offer Profile** - lists the skills they can share.
- **Request Profile** - lists the skills or services they want to learn or receive.

When two users have compatible offers and requests, the app creates a match.  
After completing their exchange, both users confirm it, and the system automatically updates their Time Wallet (personal time balance).
